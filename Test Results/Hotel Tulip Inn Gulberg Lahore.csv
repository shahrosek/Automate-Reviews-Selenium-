sukhwinder,"I stayed on 9th floor, it was amazing to be here because of its great view from the balcony. The hotel from inside is too clean, great ambiance and the staff is also very cooperative, well-dressed and polite. They also have lift facility, the good quality breakfast is served in the morning between 7 a.m to 11:00 a.m. I personally found it amazing and economical in the present time. I would highly recommend it.",5/5
Abdul Qadir,Not a good experience in this hotel. There was a door in the room which was completely unaccessible. A window which gives you view of demolished site of hotel. Breakfast was like eating spoiled food. Thet charged 175rs for a water bottle. They don't let you to keep the keys with you.,2/5
Hafsa Jafar,"Room was not as shown in the pics. Bedsheet was dirty, dirty rooms, mattress was of poor quality. Staff and head behaviour was worst. They were fighting infront of us. Not a family place at all. Pathetic services. Please don't waste your money.  The good reviews are fake enteredby themselves on demand.",1/5

Zubair Ilyas,I have booked this hotel and in picture it was showing different rooms. Once i reached there they show me a room for a servant. I complained and said i booked a better room. Then he appoligized and showed me another room on rooftop near the kitchen  which was worst then the previous one. All other rooms were empty(i confirmed from the guard) but he didnot  give me room . I think because i booked from agoda in diacounted price. I will not recommend this hotel to anyone.,1/5
DIL JALAY,Room conditions was below exceptional and services was poor staff was kind but manager was lacking and liberty was half broken..Judging by the price it was way over the line.,1/5

AC power shutdown for 8 hours. Washroom lack shampoo, washroom exhaust wasn't working, door damage, shower damage. Sparking of Circuits. Water bottle costs 150. Drilling sound from adjacent room created inconvenience. Not recommended at all.",1/5
