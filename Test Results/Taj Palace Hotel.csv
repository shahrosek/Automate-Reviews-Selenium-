Zain Ul Abedeen,Pathetic situation of rooms. Service 0. One black sheep will come to clean the room once then they wont send any person to celan the room and to change the bed sheets. Even the beds are broken. No windows for proper ventilation. Black sheep is their worker and after cleaning the room he'll ask you for bribe. The owner of hotel is foolish person uses abusive language. Never ever goto this hotel,1/5
