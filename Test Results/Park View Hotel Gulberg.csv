Sidra Javed,"My guest stayed over there, location and rooms were average but clean. breakfast was included. But they are less cooperative in facilitating the guests in terms of arranging a convince for them. As one of my guest missed his flight just because the cab was not arranged in time.",3/5
Rayhan Aziz,"It's an economy hotel at middle of Gulberg area Lahore near Ghalib Market.I was given a neat and tidy room, bed sheets and towels all were clean and sufficient sunlight also there through windows. Only issue I found was on blanket cover which needed cleaned and I got it replaced.Staff is exceptionally helpful and accommodating. They serve good tea, breakfast and food inside room at very economical prices. (though I was not very happy with the crockery they use, it seems old and substandard but it's OK at this price).No dedicated hotel covered parking but sufficient free parking avaialble outside hotel.No lifts avaialble neither any facility there for specially abled persons, so be extra careful if you accompany any specially able person.They accepted credit card and changed my room when I requested to give me a sound free room.",4/5

Haris Imtiaz,Hotel is in good location and cheap priced. I stayed there for 4 nights. Staff was very corporative. They need to improve the internet service and laundry services,4/5

USAMA AHMAD (SOCIAL MEDIA MANAGER),"I like their welcoming üôè staff . Their room service üòç was up to the mark. They also have 24 hrs security guard üíÇ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. The washroom was very clean. Bedsheets and other stuff was very clean.Thank you for making my anniversary ‚ù§ trip more valuable üíïThese are small things. Like, they can offer complementary waters bottles or drink. In my whole trip, this thing was lacking. Overall, I just love their hotel and serviceAlso, it just a suggestion, please do provide different varieties of breakfast. People like us from Islamabad love to eat Desi food.",5/5

Muhammad Kashif Khan,"Worse place not at all as shown in the pics, it was more like a SARAYE, not recommended for families....this isn't a fake review my friend (owner) you better work on improvement and not declaring the true review as fake.",1/5
Umair,"Below average rooms cleanliness but washrooms were dirty. We had to wait for more than half hour because management said rooms are not ready. Pathetic service and rude behaviour of staff. I had to go by myself for anything i wanted because they never came on call. Internet was not working and one last thing, most of 5 star reviews are paid or their own because everything of this hotel is poorest. I will never go to this hotel again",1/5
Omar Abdul,"Staff are very sly and cut the main power at night, no ac working and can‚Äôt even charge my phone. Takes over an hour for just breakfast to arrive, terrible hospitality.",1/5
Furqan Ali,According to price range it was ok.But as a hotel need to be improved.Breakfast was included in the price but didn't get proper breakfast.No computer record of guests as i forget to collect the bill later on ask for pdf bill by email didn't received my bill and moreover person on the reception was not updated ( he was refusing that  i didn't stay in room 108) after telling a lot of things he sent me a picture  of manual generated bill which is not acceptable from my company.Poor experience to stay with park view hotel Gulberg,4/5
Bilal Hameed,Very well priced.And comfortable stay.You may doubt security at times but this is no 5 star resort.It‚Äôs good for family‚Äôs who visit from Islamabad and want to stay for one or two nights. And want to roam around with peace of mind and shop around.,4/5
Asma Tanveer (Randhawa),"It's appropriate as per its rates, you can't expect 3, 4 or 5 star services what you pay here. Justified services as per rates.",4/5
Techie Talk,Overall Good Experience But The Staff of Hotel are Lazy.,4/5
