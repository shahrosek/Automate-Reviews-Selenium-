Prabhjot Gill,"This review is for a three day stay in April 2022. This was our first hotel stay in Pakistan on our first visit to the country. I cannot even begin to describe how awesome the customer service at this hotel was. The rooms were great, food was excellent, staff extremely courteous.I look forward to visiting again in the future. Thank you to all the staff at PC Lahore!!! Keep it up.",5/5
I I,"PEARL CONTINENTAL HOTEL (PC LAHORE)I stayed at the Pearl Continental (PC) Hotel Lahore this month (Nov 2022) and was dismayed at the below sub-standard quality of customer service care and the accommodation received.I have stayed at the PC Lahore on previous visits when arriving in Lahore and have always enjoyed my stay. But after this visit, I am disappointed to say that that this will be my LAST EVER visit if standards do not get better.Sorry to say If I could, I would give PC Lahore ZERO STARS!..Please also be aware of fake reviews especially from those who have recently created an account on Google or Trip Advisor and have given the hotel 5 Stars!.1.	Firstly, the hotel driver who picked me up was not at arrivals when I landed, and was left waiting  over 1 hour outside the airport entrance after having contacted the hotel to ask the whereabouts of the driver!2.	The hotel Reception Staff DEMANDED payment IN ADVANCE even before I had a chance to go to my room & put my bags down! (even though I had booked the room 2 weeks in advance with my credit card).3.	The Sub-Standard Quality of the room was ABSOLUTELY SHOCKING!!.. this is evident from the photos I have uploaded here. You can see that the levels of hygiene, room, surface finishes in the photos – even some budget hotels do not have this level of bad hygiene & cleanliness!I am sorry to say I WONT EVER be staying at the PC Lahore ever again and will go to an alternative hotel which offers much better customer service & care and where hygiene levels are what you would expect from a premium/branded hotel.	Please note the genuine 5 Star Reviews listed on Trip Advisor are mostly from local Lahore residents who come in the morning to the hotel restaurant for breakfast ONLY (and not to stay).Again, I have to say I AM ABSOLUTELY DISMAYED at the quality of customer service and room received at the Pearl Continental (PC) Hotel in Lahore and warn all guests to look elsewhere when booking.",1/5

Bilal Fatehullah,"Conveniently located at mall road, city center. Service is good and a tasty breakfast buffet is available every morning. The staff is cooperative and friendly and takes care of your comfort all the time.The only cons are1. No iron in the room2. No electric socket for room kettle3. Old furniture/sanitary4. The rooms are not sound proof as such5. Long walk from dropoff point to hotel lobby and rooms",4/5

Jvd S,"When you first walk in you will be amazed at the lobby area and range of restaurants and a mini shopping area within its grounds. It's genuinely on a grand scale with very high quality fixtures and fittings. There is a nice communal ambience  that draws people in to spend time here.The concierge service and especially one gentleman named Naheem really made us feel well and informed in every aspect and comfortable.That said, I wish I could say the same about the rooms and room cleaning. They felt very dated and flafter the rooms were cleaned, they were not at the level expected or the hotel deserves.Overall a great enjoyable stay and we would come back, however we would be inspect the room prior to unpacking.",4/5

Amin Jalaluddin,There were more than dozen complaints in my 09 nights stay. However most of time your senior managers played effective and significant role in resolving those complaints.But some of your junior staff respects customer by looking at their face value. Kindly tell them they should make sure all guests feel welcomed not only those who are high profile. Learn from Islamabad Marriott.Last but not least your mattress are least comfortable especially for guests who are having back problems.,3/5
Ibby 35,"The hotel is a nice hotel, which has really good breakfast options and a very nice lobby which is kept very clean. But the rooms are not as modern as I would have expected. The bathroom could do with renovations. And the mattresses are not good as it feels like you are floating on water (the mattress is too soft and not very comfortable)",4/5
Amereen Shahzad,After hearing the hype of this hotel. I was disappointed in my visit. the standard room was below quality with chipped tiles and dirty bedding. The decor and maintenance was also shocking for the prices they charge. I feel they cater for executive and club members more than normal customers.  The main part of the hotel is beautiful and up kept but hardly any seating to enjoy music and ambience in the lobby. Prices are extortionate for above the charges the already take for room charges so be prepared to spend a lot of money for low quality.I tried out the salon for a manicure and pedicure which was good but they didn’t have a nail light to dry the polish so by the time I got to my room my nails were ruined and chipped as they were still wet .,2/5
Akash M Shahzad,"I have recently been there for Payoneer Forum 2022 with my business partners. The Crystal Hall, in which the event was held was very spacious and well lit (light up). The staff and security were very professional (the also prevented a mob of late attendees to disturb the event). The provided refreshments were also delicious. All the stage and interior were up to the marks. A must visit for business professionals, as well as casual people.",5/5
Ambr Jamal,"Had an awesome experience at Marco Polo Pearl Continental HotelNow serving Buffet with live stations catering to all sorts of taste & preferences from world cuisine menu every Saturday.The wide choices of delicacies and desserts really got my eyes bulging.There was seriously a lot of food to choose from and I didn’t even know where to begin. From savoury to appetizers and desserts, you would be spoilt for choice.Highly Recommended",4/5
M ejaz Ejaz,Mr Hassan at the time of check out provided great services. Front office team are very good specially huma and maher's. Clean rooms and we'll maintained building,5/5
Malik Nauman,"Old, but not maintained very well. Room furniture and bathroom accessories needs to be upgraded, the upkeep is also poor, you'll find dust easily around. Needs some serious efforts to make it worth 4/5 star hotel.",2/5
Indra Adhikari,"Plenty of potential!The food and rooms are both good. However, the cleanliness is not there and also the maintenance needs to be done regularly to keep the property in good condition. There's too much noise all the time and sound sleep is impossible.",4/5
WSM,Nice place for events and rooms for foreign and domestic guests. The Palace Hall that we booked was huge. Good helping staff for arrangements and food was tasty. We had our guests happy for being invited to PC. As always :),5/5
Asim chaudhary,Prime location. Security is very good. Staff are the biggest asset. Very friendly.  The downside is the hotel is showing a lot of wear and tear. Very old carpets and bathrooms are also in a very bad condition. I have been staying at this hotel regularly over the last 15 year in which time no modifications have been made apart from the tv’s.I am now looking at alternatives because of lack of investment and condition of rooms. I normally stay in their executive rooms but this time stayed in a suite which was no different.,3/5
Vijay Kumar,I stayed in room 224 room was clean. Smooth check in and check out services given by hamza and Hassan. Guest relations were very helpful Huma and mahera. Well maintained building. Will come again,5/5
Zeenat Qureshi,"Went to Marco Polo for dinner buffet which started 7.30pm onwards. Mostly dishes were missing their name tags.. sushi was disaster, desi food is good to be considered while going there.Good variety of sweet dishesI had problems with used plates not being removed proactively, I have to look for the staff to give them backAs I was told by my fellows, PC is over hyped place with raw veg options and nothing much. Somehow it turned out to be true.",3/5
