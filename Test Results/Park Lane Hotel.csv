Raheel Siddiqui,"Stayed for about 4 days.. i am sure you will find a lot of other better hotels in this proce range.. the positive points are its location, rooms were also cleaned.. but we had a constant issue with its key card and power circuit breaker.. no kettles in room, so we have to always ask for hot water for children's milk. Iron should also be in room in this price range, but you always have to call house keeping for iron. Hotel staff was cooperative and responded timely. A little improvement will make this hotel great.",4/5
Fahd Ameen Dogar,"The location of hotel is good. But room service, food and even comfort level is low and not worth the price you pay for this. Air conditioning remains a constant problem. Some washrooms have leakage issue. Food is worst of all. Utensils have bad smell. Cooking standard is poor. Overall, not recommended at this price.",2/5
Usman Ali,"Hotel Park Lane in Lahore Both the setting and the food were excellent. The fresh food is of excellent quality, abundant, real, and delicious. Hi tea.

Daud Asif,"Awesome food from The Coffee Lounge, Park Lane HotelThe Coffee Lounge is located at Ground Floor of the Park Lane Hotel. It has a Continental, Chinese, Fast Food as well snacks in menu along coffee, signature drinks etc..We tried British Fish & Chips 🇬🇧 🐟  and American Grilled Chicken 🇺🇸🐔 . British Fish and Chips had three large fillets of fish 🐟 and served with generous amount of French Fries 🍟 and tartar sauce. It was finger licking good. 😋 American Grilled Chicken had soft, tender and juciy fillets of chicken 🐔 grilled to perfection. It was very flavorful and was served with sautéed veggies, mushrooms 🍄 and had delicious sauce..Portion size was large. Both dishes were very fulfilling and tasted amazing. 😋.🇬🇧 🐟 British Fish & Chips Rs 1350🇺🇸🐔 American Grilled Chicken Rs 1295.📍The Coffee Lounge, Park Lane Hotel, Gulberg, Lahore.",4/5
Zeenat Qureshi,"I went for buffet as advertised on Instagram, specially arranged on the occasion of Christmas and Quaid's day. The chowmein was mentioned in the menu but not available. Then the cold drink tin was of 199pkr, the welcome drink was served late.. and at the time of bill there was 16%gst even the payment was about to be made on card, to which the person said we are hotel and unlike restaurant we can't revise our gst..Their finger fish was amazing, bbq was undercooked, overall good place to enjoy apart from gst portion..",3/5

Over all experience of stay is good however I have a small observation regarding their buffet at roof top. The quality of, service and even menu is OK however their taste falls short as per Lahore Standards.",4/5
